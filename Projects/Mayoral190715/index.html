<b>Notes:</b>
<ol>
<li> Candidates who have not yet done any fundraising are not obligated to
	file this report.
</li>
	
<li> Although compressed, The zip is a HUGE file that might take some time to 
	download.
	<br>(Update: divided into multiple zipfiles, by candidate;
	Strimling is still quite large at 500MB.)
</li>

<li> There are a total of 134 images here.
</li>

<li> This includes mostly mayoral candidates, but also a couple of other
	offices, such as school board.
</li>

<li>These were taken by Clare on 7/16/19 at about 4pm at City Hall. I
	spoke to Melissa, who gave me a folder of the paperwork, and I took a
	picture of each page in the folder. (I know that I got some pages twice,
	but left everything here for now.)
</li>

<li> As of this posting, no one has looked through these to see if they
	are readable and complete.
	</li>

<li> If any pages seem to be missing or corrupted, please let me know:
	clare@openmaine.org
	</li>
</ol>

<br>
We will be creating a spreadsheet of this information over the next few
weeks, to make it more readily accessible.
