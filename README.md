NOT the OpenMaine website, but info that we want to be more readily
available on the web.

The live page is at http://openmaine.github.io


The OpenMaine website is online here: http://openmaine.org/


This will be a place to upload static documents that we need to share out;
for now, just using raw HTML.


Comments/questions to clare@openmaine.org or hello@openmaine.org
